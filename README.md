I have created a script in python that prompts the user to enter password and checks against a set of predefined rules for password strength.
Things we need to implement are as follows :

> Minimum length of 12 characters.
> At least one lowercase letter.
> At least one uppercase letter.
> At least one digit.
> At least one special character.
